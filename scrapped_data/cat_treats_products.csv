Most recently I added this immune balance and the immune boost supplements to her diet and I think it's doing a great job! Having cancer my dog's immune system is quite compromised. Along this journey I have been tailoring her diet as signs or symptoms change/present. A bit less than a month ago my main concern was her compromised immune system, her blood work was actually looking good (all things considered) but as expected, her WBC's were notably lower. I had noticed more frequent tear stains and that beagle-y yeast smell. Having cancer and a very specific diet I have been trying to stick to a wholistic based diet with her so I thought I would check out some more products here. I read some reviews about positive responses to the combination of the immune boost and immune balance. With just a few ingredients I was happy to give it a whirl! Well, it has been just over two weeks since I started Beesly on these two supplements and I have already noticed a decrease in tear stains, brighter color in her face and even in her gums! I am excited to see her blood work recheck results in a couple more weeks but I am pretty optimistic that these immune supporting supplements have played a significant role for her. :)"",""reviewRating"":{""@type"":""Rating"",""worstRating"":1,""ratingValue"":5,""bestRating"":5},""author"":{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""KYLIA MACE""}},{""@type"":""Review"",""name"":""Awesome source of colostrum!"",""datePublished"":""January 7, 2024"",""reviewBody"":""I am a big fan of colostrum, and love that Wholistic offers single ingredient Bovine colostrum!

We have cut out all the normal food related allergens but due to the cycle for his worse flare ups, our vet feels seasonal allergies are one of his main issues.  He won't stop scratching his sides or licking his paws which end up red and swollen. He has been on allergy medication and we have even resorted to Apoquel.  There are always down sides to prescription medications which made me do some more digging and I found information on Colostrum.  Wholistic Pet Organics has always been a company with high quality products that our pets have always done well on so I came here first when I was ready to give it a try.  \r\n\r\nWe have been giving our pug the Colostrum Powder supplement for about a week and a half and have already noticed a difference.  Giving him this once a day is the only thing that is new to his diet and daily activities.  He is no longer itching incessantly and we have not needed to administer any Apoquel even after going for walks in fields or nature trails.  He has basically stopped licking his paws, basically because he may start but when we ask him to stop, he is able to when in the past he was not.  We have also noticed his paws are no longer red or swollen.  His ears are less inflamed and have less gunk in them which is an added plus since he does suffer from ear infections.  At this point, this supplement is a miracle.  \r\n\r\nWe are hopeful that this may be the answer we have been looking for and once again Wholistic Pet Organics have come thru with a fantastic product that our pets can benefit from for a healthier, happier life."",""reviewRating"":{""@type"":""Rating"",""worstRating"":1,""ratingValue"":5,""bestRating"":5},""author"":{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""GLouise""}}],""aggregateRating"":{""@type"":""AggregateRating"",""ratingValue"":5,""bestRating"":5,""reviewCount"":15}}","{""@context"":""https://schema.org"",""@type"":""BreadcrumbList"",""itemListElement"":[{""@type"":""ListItem"",""position"":1,""item"":{""@type"":""Thing"",""@id"":""https://www.walmart.com/cp/pets/5440"",""name"":""Pets""}},{""@type"":""ListItem"",""position"":2,""item"":{""@type"":""Thing"",""@id"":""https://www.walmart.com/cp/cats/202073"",""name"":""Cats""}},{""@type"":""ListItem"",""position"":3,""item"":{""@type"":""Thing"",""@id"":""https://www.walmart.com/browse/pets/cat-treats/5440_202073_6005312"",""name"":""Cat Treats""}},{""@type"":""ListItem"",""position"":4,""item"":{""@type"":""Thing"",""@id"":""https://www.walmart.com/browse/pets/calming-cat-treats/5440_202073_6005312_2407696"",""name"":""Calming Cat Treats""}}]}",,"[{""details"":""Brand""},{""details"":""Wholistic Pet Organics""},{""details"":""Manufacturer""},{""details"":""Wholistic Pet Organics""},{""details"":""Manufacturer Part Number""},{""details"":""0146""},{""details"":""Assembled Product Weight""},{""details"":""1 oz""}]"
